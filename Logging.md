sed [options] commands [file-to-edit]
sed '' BSD				# cat BSD
cat BSD | sed ''

# sed operates on data line by line. It reads a line, operates on it, and outputs the resulting text before repeating the process on the next line.
sed 'p' BSD				# print each line twice on the screen
sed -n 'p' BSD				# avoids the automatic printing

sed -n '1p' BSD				# print the first line
sed -n '1,5p' BSD			# print line 1 to 5 (line range)
sed -n '1,+4p' BSD			# start at line 1 and then operate on the next 4 lines as well
sed -n '1~2p' BSD			# prints every other line (print line 1,3,5,7...), we can specify ~3 or ~4
sed '1,5d' BSD				# delete line 1 to 5 from the output and print other lines
sed '1~2d' BSD > everyother.txt

sed -i '1~2d' everyother.txt		# This will alter the source file, not only outputs on the screen
sed -i.bak '1~2d' everyother.txt	# creates a backup file with the .bak extension, and then edits the
					# original file in-place.
# Substituting Text
s/old_word/new_word/			# "s" is the substitute command and in this case slash / is the delimiter
					# but we can use different delimiter like _,-,+ or others for it
echo "http://www.example.com/index.html" | sed 's_com/index_org/home_'	# replaces com/index with org/home
sed 's/on/forward/' song.txt		# the "s" command operates on any first match (on, song, son) in a line
sed 's/on/forward/g' song.txt		# replace the all "on" in a line with "forward" not only the first one
sed 's/on/forward/2' song.txt		# replace only the second "on" in each line with "forward"
sed -n 's/on/forward/2p' song.txt	# print the substituted lines

# Replacing and Referencing Matched Text
sed 's/^.*at/REPLACED/' song.txt	# replace everything (from beginning of the line to "at") with REPLACED
sed 's/^.*at/(&)/' song.txt		# see what we are replacing in ()


# for the first match, replace any word that have the expression characters with escaped references:
sed 's/\([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9]*\) \([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9]*\)/\2 \1/' song.txt
# we create a match and then referce it by \1, \2, \3 etc.
# () : we create the match inside ()
# [a-zA-Z0-9] : one character
# [a-zA-Z0-9]* : any and multiple character
# \([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9]*\) \([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9]*\) : 
[one or any character that match with expression]space[same]
# \2 \1 : [escaped reference 2]space[escaped reference 1]

# for the first match, replace [any word]space[any word] with escaped references:
sed 's/\([^ ][^ ]*\) \([^ ][^ ]*\)/\2 \1/' song.txt
# [^ ] : any character that is not a space
# I think the [^ ] is not required here and only below can do the same:
sed 's/\([^ ]*\) \([^ ]*\)/\2 \1/' song.txt



sed 's/\(..\)/0x\1, /g' candata.txt			# put 0x in the first of each two each two characters
							# and put a comma and a space at the end of them

sed 's/.*/[&]/' input_file				# put each line in a []
